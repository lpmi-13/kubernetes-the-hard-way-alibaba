# About

This was an attempt to bootstrap a kubernetes cluster on Alibaba Cloud, but it was very difficult, and trying to set things up on Alibaba Cloud is not recommended at this time.

> TL;DR - creating 2 micro VMs results in a fraud warning, and public IPv4 addresses for the network load balancers took a few hours to be ready. This cloud is not production ready.

If you get it working, let me know.
